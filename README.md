# 💖 The "Impossible No" Valentine Proposal 💖

A fun, interactive, and slightly "cheeky" web page to ask someone to be your Valentine. This project features a **"No" button that runs away** whenever the cursor gets close, making "Yes" the only reachable option!



## ✨ Features
- **The Dodger:** A "No" button that moves randomly within the card boundaries.
- **The Growing Yes:** Every time the "No" button is dodged, the "Yes" button grows larger.
- **Personalized:** Specifically designed for "Maddie," but easily customizable.
- **Celebration Mode:** Once "Yes" is clicked, the background pulses and a custom GIF/Image appears.

## 🚀 How to use this for your partner
If you want to use this for your own GF/BF, follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repository** or copy the code from `index.html`.
2. **Personalize the Name:** Open `index.html` and search for "Maddie". Replace it with your partner's name.
3. **Change the Image:** Find the `<img>` tag in the `message` div. Replace the URL with a link to your own favorite photo or GIF.
4. **Host it for free:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Set the branch to `main` and click **Save**.
   - Share the link with your person!
